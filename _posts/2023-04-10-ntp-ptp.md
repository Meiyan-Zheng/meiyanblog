title: NTP vs PTP

## What is NTP? 

The `Network Time Protocol (NTP)` is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems 
over networks. NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few milliseconds of UTC. 

NTP uses a hierarchical, semi-layered system of time sources. Each level of this hierarchy is termed a `stratum`
and is assigned a number starting with zero for reference clock at the top. A server synchronized to a `stratum n`
server runs at `stratum n + 1`.

#### How NTP works?

The synchronization process is as follows:

- Device A sends Device B an NTP message, which is timestamped when it leaves Device A. The timestamp is 10:00:00 am (T1).
- When this NTP message arrives at Device B, it is timestamped by Device B. The timestamp is 11:00:01 am (T2).
- When the NTP message leaves Device B, Device B timestamps it. The timestamp is 11:00:02 am (T3).
- When Device A receives the NTP message, the local time of Device A is 10:00:03 am (T4).

Up to now, Device A can calculate the following parameters based on the timestamps:

- The roundtrip delay of NTP message: Delay = (T4–T1) – (T3-T2) = 2 seconds.
- Time difference between Device A and Device B: Offset = ((T2-T1) + (T3-T4))/2 = 1 hour.

## What is PTP?

The `Precision Time Protocol (PTP)` is a protocol used to synchronize clocks throughout a computer network. 

The first version of PTP, IEEE 1588-2002, was published in 2002. 
IEEE 1588-2008, also known as PTP Version 2 is not backward compatible with the 2002 version. 
IEEE 1588-2019 was published in November 2019 and includes backward-compatible improvements to the 2008 publication. 

According to John Eidson, who led the IEEE 1588-2002 standardization effort, "IEEE 1588 is designed to 
fill a niche not well served by either of the two dominant protocols, NTP and GPS. IEEE 1588 is designed 
for local systems requiring accuracies beyond those attainable using NTP. It is also designed for applications 
that cannot bear the cost of a GPS receiver at each node, or for which GPS signals are inaccessible."

Two separate delay values must be determined: the delay from the master to slave, and from the slave to master.

##### To calculate the delay from the master to slave:
T1 is the initial timestamp, and is the exact time the sync message is sent by the master. 
Since T1 is an accurate recording of when the sync message was transmitted via the Ethernet port, 
it is sent in the follow-up message.

T2 is the second timestamp, and is the exact time the slave receives the sync message.

Once both T1 and T2 are available at the slave, the delay value between the master and the slave 
can be determined through the calculation T2 – T1.

##### To calculate the delay from the slave to the master:
T3 is the third timestamp, and is the exact time the delay request message is sent from the slave. 
T4 is the fourth and final timestamp, and is the exact time the master receives the delay request message.

Once both T3 and T4 are available at the slave, the delay value between the slave and the master 
can be determined through the calculation T4 – T3.

Once both the master to slave, and slave to master differences are available at the slave, the one-way 
delay can be determined. One-way delay = (master to slave difference + slave to master difference) / 2

An offset value is then calculated to adjust the slave clock:
Offset = master to slave difference – one-way delay

This can be simplified as:
Offset = ((T2 - T1) - (T4 - T3)) / 2

By utilising this offset, the slave clock can adjust its time to ensure it matches the master clock.


## Advantages of PTP over NTP

One of the main advantages that PTP has over NTP is the hardware support present in various network 
interface controllers (NIC) and network switches. The specialized hardware allows PTP to account for 
delays in message transfer and improves the accuracy of time synchronization. To achieve the best 
possible accuracy, it is recommended that all networking components between PTP clocks are PTP hardware 
enabled.

Hardware-based PTP provides optimal accuracy, since the NIC can time stamp the PTP packets at the exact 
moment they are sent and received. Compare this to software-based PTP, which requires additional processing 
of the PTP packets by the operating system.
